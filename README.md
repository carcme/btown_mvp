# B-Town: THE one-stop app for Berlin.



App is on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.carc.btown). 

[Home Page](https://carcmedev.github.io/btown/index.html). Still a work in progress.


## Features
B-Town is primarily a Berlin based map application. The map aspect of the app can be
used throughout the world

#### OSM MAP
Driven by local knowledge, OpenStreetMap is updated daily by user across the world. OSM
is is an open-source alternative to Google Maps, Mapquest and Waze and has details
missing from other maps


#### POPULAR PLACES LISTS
Finding popular attractions, trending places and Wikipedia entries is easy with integrated
[Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/ "Wikipedia") and
 [FourSquare](https://foursquare.com/ "FourSquare").


#### SEARCH ANY LOCATION
Search any area for relavent POIs, whether is a local cafe, somewhere to get a drink
or a meal or the next tourist attraction that grabs your interest.
Using [Overpass](http://overpass-api.de, "Overpass"), we'll find those places and give
you all the information available, ranging from `opening times`, `telephone numbers`,
`websites`, `costs`


#### AUTO-COMPLETE SEARCH
Find what you're looking for with a few key presses
using [Komoot](http://photon.komoot.de "Komoot") search engine to give you the best results


#### ROUTING
I've removed the routing feature as Google does this much better than I could ever hope to.
The skeleton code is still there but its not maintained (not sure I even bothered to clean it
up)


### BERLIN ONLY

There are many extras for Berlin users. There are a number of walking tours (more planned),
some local information for moving around the city, a list of popular blogs to get additional
information and some lists or popular things to do while here.

##### Additional Berlin Project
If you're interested in Berlin only projects, have a peek at [Stolpersteine Berlin](https://github.com/carcme/stolpersteine "Stolpersteine")


## ToDo List
- [ ] `Covert Venue lookups to DataBase / LiveData entries and remove passing them in Intents`
- [ ] Create variant for only map app.. remove all Berlin based stuff
- [ ] Add functionality to map long press -> POI lists -> overflow button
- [ ] Ratings
